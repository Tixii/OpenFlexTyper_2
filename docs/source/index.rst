Requirements
^^^^^^^^^^^^

FlexTyper requires :

-  A modern, C++17 ready compiler such as gcc 7.4.0 or higher.
-  Qt version 5.11.0
-  A 64-bit operating system. Currently, Linux supported
-  For increased performance on large number of queries, we recommand
   using a SSC-like machine

Build from source
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To Download and install FlexTyper, use the following commands :

.. code:: bash

   git clone https://github.com/wassermanlab/FlexTyper.git
   cd FMTyper/
   mkdir build
   cd build
   qmake ..
   make

or just

Getting Started
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To get you started with FlexTyper, you can start by creating a
Setting.ini file. Setting.ini files look like the following, and are a
convenient resource file used when running FlexTyper.

`Example of FlexTyper Setting file`_

As you can see, the configuration contains all information needed to run
a search.

Example of execution
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Launching a search is very easy, just call FlexTyper with the
configuration file that your populated.

.. code:: bash

   ./FlexTyper ftsearch_config -c Settings.ini

Benchmarks
^^^^^^^^^^

To ensure the FlexTyper application runs efficiently on your system, we
suggest you to run the Benchmark test. The Benchmark test the
application against a set of Perfect FmIndex reads. After running the
Benchmark, you can compare the results and check that, in monothreaded
search, the results match the following results :
